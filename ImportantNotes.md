# General Tips

1. Create a new file for EACH exercise (unless stated otherwise) or topic. 
Keeping everything in the same files makes it much harder to spot mistakes since they could stem from previous code parts.
2. Always check IDE (integrated development environment, e.g. VS Code) for red squiggly lines -> There is something wrong with your code (don't forget to save after you changed something)
3. Save often, run often: 
   1. Save your file regularly so you don't accidentally lose progress if your computer crashes.
   2. Run the code often. Try to split the code in the small completable steps which you can quickly check by running. Writing one big block in one go is especially hard in the beginning.
